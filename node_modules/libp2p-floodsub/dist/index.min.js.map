This encoding is\n * commonly used to store data for PKI, i.e. X.509 Certificates, and this\n * implementation exists for that purpose.\n *\n * Abstract Syntax Notation Number One (ASN.1) is used to define the abstract\n * syntax of information without restricting the way the information is encoded\n * for transmission. It provides a standard that allows for open systems\n * communication. ASN.1 defines the syntax of information data and a number of\n * simple data types as well as a notation for describing them and specifying\n * values for them.\n *\n * The RSA algorithm creates public and private keys that are often stored in\n * X.509 or PKCS#X formats -- which use ASN.1 (encoded in DER format). This\n * class provides the most basic functionality required to store and load DSA\n * keys that are encoded according to ASN.1.\n *\n * The most common binary encodings for ASN.1 are BER (Basic Encoding Rules)\n * and DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules). DER is just a subset of BER that\n * has stricter requirements for how data must be encoded.\n *\n * Each ASN.1 structure has a tag (a byte identifying the ASN.1 structure type)\n * and a byte array for the value of this ASN1 structure which may be data or a\n * list of ASN.1 structures.\n *\n * Each ASN.1 structure using BER is (Tag-Length-Value):\n *\n * | byte 0 | bytes X | bytes Y |\n * |--------|---------|----------\n * |  tag   | length  |  value  |\n *\n * ASN.1 allows for tags to be of \"High-tag-number form\" which allows a tag to\n * be two or more octets, but that is not supported by this class. A tag is\n * only 1 byte. Bits 1-5 give the tag number (ie the data type within a\n * particular 'class'), 6 indicates whether or not the ASN.1 value is\n * constructed from other ASN.1 values, and bits 7 and 8 give the 'class'. If\n * bits 7 and 8 are both zero, the class is UNIVERSAL. If only bit 7 is set,\n * then the class is APPLICATION. If only bit 8 is set, then the class is\n * CONTEXT_SPECIFIC. If both bits 7 and 8 are set, then the class is PRIVATE.\n * The tag numbers for the data types for the class UNIVERSAL are listed below:\n *\n * UNIVERSAL 0 Reserved for use by the encoding rules\n * UNIVERSAL 1 Boolean type\n * UNIVERSAL 2 Integer type\n * UNIVERSAL 3 Bitstring type\n * UNIVERSAL 4 Octetstring type\n * UNIVERSAL 5 Null type\n * UNIVERSAL 6 Object identifier type\n * UNIVERSAL 7 Object descriptor type\n * UNIVERSAL 8 External type and Instance-of type\n * UNIVERSAL 9 Real type\n * UNIVERSAL 10 Enumerated type\n * UNIVERSAL 11 Embedded-pdv type\n * UNIVERSAL 12 UTF8String type\n * UNIVERSAL 13 Relative object identifier type\n * UNIVERSAL 14-15 Reserved for future editions\n * UNIVERSAL 16 Sequence and Sequence-of types\n * UNIVERSAL 17 Set and Set-of types\n * UNIVERSAL 18-22, 25-30 Character string types\n * UNIVERSAL 23-24 Time types\n *\n * The length of an ASN.1 structure is specified after the tag identifier.\n * There is a definite form and an indefinite form. The indefinite form may\n * be used if the encoding is constructed and not all immediately available.\n * The indefinite form is encoded using a length byte with only the 8th bit\n * set. The end of the constructed object is marked using end-of-contents\n * octets (two zero bytes).\n *\n * The definite form looks like this:\n *\n * The length may take up 1 or more bytes, it depends on the length of the\n * value of the ASN.1 structure. DER encoding requires that if the ASN.1\n * structure has a value that has a length greater than 127, more than 1 byte\n * will be used to store its length, otherwise just one byte will be used.\n * This is strict.\n *\n * In the case that the length of the ASN.1 value is less than 127, 1 octet\n * (byte) is used to store the \"short form\" length. The 8th bit has a value of\n * 0 indicating the length is \"short form\" and not \"long form\" and bits 7-1\n * give the length of the data. (The 8th bit is the left-most, most significant\n * bit: also known as big endian or network format).\n *\n * In the case that the length of the ASN.1 value is greater than 127, 2 to\n * 127 octets (bytes) are used to store the \"long form\" length. The first\n * byte's 8th bit is set to 1 to indicate the length is \"long form.\" Bits 7-1\n * give the number of additional octets. All following octets are in base 256\n * with the most significant digit first (typical big-endian binary unsigned\n * integer storage). So, for instance, if the length of a value was 257, the\n * first byte would be set to:\n *\n * 10000010 = 130 = 0x82.\n *\n * This indicates there are 2 octets (base 256) for the length. The second and\n * third bytes (the octets just mentioned) would store the length in base 256:\n *\n * octet 2: 00000001 = 1 * 256^1 = 256\n * octet 3: 00000001 = 1 * 256^0 = 1\n * total = 257\n *\n * The algorithm for converting a js integer value of 257 to base-256 is:\n *\n * var value = 257;\n * var bytes = [];\n * bytes[0] = (value >>> 8) & 0xFF; // most significant byte first\n * bytes[1] = value & 0xFF;        // least significant byte last\n *\n * On the ASN.1 UNIVERSAL Object Identifier (OID) type:\n *\n * An OID can be written like: \"value1.value2.value3...valueN\"\n *\n * The DER encoding rules:\n *\n * The first byte has the value 40 * value1 + value2.\n * The following bytes, if any, encode the remaining values. Each value is\n * encoded in base 128, most significant digit first (big endian), with as\n * few digits as possible, and the most significant bit of each byte set\n * to 1 except the last in each value's encoding. For example: Given the\n * OID \"1.2.840.113549\", its DER encoding is (remember each byte except the\n * last one in each encoding is OR'd with 0x80):\n *\n * byte 1: 40 * 1 + 2 = 42 = 0x2A.\n * bytes 2-3: 128 * 6 + 72 = 840 = 6 72 = 6 72 = 0x0648 = 0x8648\n * bytes 4-6: 16384 * 6 + 128 * 119 + 13 = 6 119 13 = 0x06770D = 0x86F70D\n *\n * The final value is: 0x2A864886F70D.\n * The full OID (including ASN.1 tag and length of 6 bytes) is:\n * 0x06062A864886F70D\n */\nvar forge = require('./forge');\n\nrequire('./util');\n\nrequire('./oids');\n/* ASN.1 API */\n\n\nvar asn1 = module.exports = forge.asn1 = forge.asn1 || {};\n/**\n * ASN.1 classes.\n */\n\nasn1.Class = {\n  UNIVERSAL: 0x00,\n  APPLICATION: 0x40,\n  CONTEXT_SPECIFIC: 0x80,\n  PRIVATE: 0xC0\n};\n/**\n * ASN.1 types.

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n/*<replacement>*/\n\n\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\n\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\nfunction afterTransform(er, data) {\n  var ts = this._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb) {\n    return this.emit('error', new Error('write callback called multiple times'));\n  }\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n  if (data != null) // single equals check for both `null` and `undefined`\n    this.push(data);\n  cb(er);\n  var rs = this._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    this._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n  this._transformState = {\n    afterTransform: afterTransform.bind(this),\n    needTransform: false,\n    transforming: false,\n    writecb: null,\n    writechunk: null,\n    writeencoding: null\n  }; // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true; // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  if (options) {\n    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n  } // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n\n\n  this.on('prefinish', prefinish);\n}\n\nfunction prefinish() {\n  var _this = this;\n\n  if (typeof this._flush === 'function') {\n    this._flush(function (er, data) {\n      done(_this, er, data);\n    });\n  } else {\n    done(this, null, null);\n  }\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n}; // This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.

For any\n    integers x1, x2, ..., xk there exists an integer x solving the\n    system of simultaneous congruences (where ~= means modularly\n    congruent so a ~= b mod n means a mod n = b mod n):\n     x ~= x1 mod n1\n    x ~= x2 mod n2\n    ...\n    x ~= xk mod nk\n     This system of congruences has a single simultaneous solution x\n    between 0 and n - 1. Furthermore, each xk solution and x itself\n    is congruent modulo the product n = n1*n2*...*nk.\n    So x1 mod n = x2 mod n = xk mod n = x mod n.\n     The single simultaneous solution x can be solved with the following\n    equation:\n     x = sum(xi*ri*si) mod n where ri = n/ni and si = ri^-1 mod ni.\n     Where x is less than n, xi = x mod ni.\n     For RSA we are only concerned with k = 2. The modulus n = pq, where\n    p and q are coprime. The RSA decryption algorithm is:\n     y = x^d mod n\n     Given the above:\n     x1 = x^d mod p\n    r1 = n/p = q\n    s1 = q^-1 mod p\n    x2 = x^d mod q\n    r2 = n/q = p\n    s2 = p^-1 mod q\n     So y = (x1r1s1 + x2r2s2) mod n\n         = ((x^d mod p)q(q^-1 mod p) + (x^d mod q)p(p^-1 mod q)) mod n\n     According to Fermat's Little Theorem, if the modulus P is prime,\n    for any integer A not evenly divisible by P, A^(P-1) ~= 1 mod P.\n    Since A is not divisible by P it follows that if:\n    N ~= M mod (P - 1), then A^N mod P = A^M mod P. Therefore:\n     A^N mod P = A^(M mod (P - 1)) mod P. (The latter takes less effort\n    to calculate). In order to calculate x^d mod p more quickly the\n    exponent d mod (p - 1) is stored in the RSA private key (the same\n    is done for x^d mod q). These values are referred to as dP and dQ\n    respectively. Therefore we now have:\n     y = ((x^dP mod p)q(q^-1 mod p) + (x^dQ mod q)p(p^-1 mod q)) mod n\n     Since we'll be reducing x^dP by modulo p (same for q) we can also\n    reduce x by p (and q respectively) before hand. Therefore, let\n     xp = ((x mod p)^dP mod p), and\n    xq = ((x mod q)^dQ mod q), yielding:\n     y = (xp*q*(q^-1 mod p) + xq*p*(p^-1 mod q)) mod n\n     This can be further reduced to a simple algorithm that only\n    requires 1 inverse (the q inverse is used) to be used and stored.\n    The algorithm is called Garner's algorithm. If qInv is the\n    inverse of q, we simply calculate:\n     y = (qInv*(xp - xq) mod p) * q + xq\n     However, there are two further complications. First, we need to\n    ensure that xp > xq to prevent signed BigIntegers from being used\n    so we add p until this is true (since we will be mod'ing with\n    p anyway). Then, there is a known timing attack on algorithms\n    using the CRT. To mitigate this risk, \"cryptographic blinding\"\n    should be used. This requires simply generating a random number r\n    between 0 and n-1 and its inverse and multiplying x by r^e before\n    calculating y and then multiplying y by r^-1 afterwards. Note that\n    r must be coprime with n (gcd(r, n) === 1) in order to have an\n    inverse.\n  */\n  // cryptographic blinding\n\n\n  var r;\n\n  do {\n    r = new BigInteger(forge.util.bytesToHex(forge.random.getBytes(key.n.bitLength() / 8)), 16);\n  } while (r.compareTo(key.n) >= 0 || !r.gcd(key.n).equals(BigInteger.ONE));\n\n  x = x.multiply(r.modPow(key.e, key.n)).mod(key.n); // calculate xp and xq\n\n  var xp = x.mod(key.p).modPow(key.dP, key.p);\n  var xq = x.mod(key.q).modPow(key.dQ, key.q); // xp must be larger than xq to avoid signed bit usage\n\n  while (xp.compareTo(xq) < 0) {\n    xp = xp.add(key.p);\n  } // do last step\n\n\n  var y = xp.subtract(xq).multiply(key.qInv).mod(key.p).multiply(key.q).add(xq); // remove effect of random for cryptographic blinding\n\n  y = y.multiply(r.modInverse(key.n)).mod(key.n);\n  return y;\n};\n/**\n * NOTE: THIS METHOD IS DEPRECATED, use 'sign' on a private key object or\n * 'encrypt' on a public key object instead.\n *\n * Performs RSA encryption.\n *\n * The parameter bt controls whether to put padding bytes before the\n * message passed in.

AES defines\n * its own methods of addition and multiplication but keeps some important\n * properties the same, ie: associativity and distributivity. The\n * explanation below tries to shed some light on how AES defines addition\n * and multiplication of bytes and 32-bit words in order to perform its\n * encryption and decryption algorithms.\n *\n * The basics:\n *\n * The AES algorithm views bytes as binary representations of polynomials\n * that have either 1 or 0 as the coefficients. It defines the addition\n * or subtraction of two bytes as the XOR operation. It also defines the\n * multiplication of two bytes as a finite field referred to as GF(2^8)\n * (Note: 'GF' means \"Galois Field\" which is a field that contains a finite\n * number of elements so GF(2^8) has 256 elements).\n *\n * This means that any two bytes can be represented as binary polynomials;\n * when they multiplied together and modularly reduced by an irreducible\n * polynomial of the 8th degree, the results are the field GF(2^8). The\n * specific irreducible polynomial that AES uses in hexadecimal is 0x11b.\n * This multiplication is associative with 0x01 as the identity:\n *\n * (b * 0x01 = GF(b, 0x01) = b).\n *\n * The operation GF(b, 0x02) can be performed at the byte level by left\n * shifting b once and then XOR'ing it (to perform the modular reduction)\n * with 0x11b if b is >= 128. Repeated application of the multiplication\n * of 0x02 can be used to implement the multiplication of any two bytes.\n *\n * For instance, multiplying 0x57 and 0x13, denoted as GF(0x57, 0x13), can\n * be performed by factoring 0x13 into 0x01, 0x02, and 0x10. Then these\n * factors can each be multiplied by 0x57 and then added together. To do\n * the multiplication, values for 0x57 multiplied by each of these 3 factors\n * can be precomputed and stored in a table. To add them, the values from\n * the table are XOR'd together.\n *\n * AES also defines addition and multiplication of words, that is 4-byte\n * numbers represented as polynomials of 3 degrees where the coefficients\n * are the values of the bytes.\n *\n * The word [a0, a1, a2, a3] is a polynomial a3x^3 + a2x^2 + a1x + a0.\n *\n * Addition is performed by XOR'ing like powers of x. Multiplication\n * is performed in two steps, the first is an algebriac expansion as\n * you would do normally (where addition is XOR). But the result is\n * a polynomial larger than 3 degrees and thus it cannot fit in a word. So\n * next the result is modularly reduced by an AES-specific polynomial of\n * degree 4 which will always produce a polynomial of less than 4 degrees\n * such that it will fit in a word. In AES, this polynomial is x^4 + 1.\n *\n * The modular product of two polynomials 'a' and 'b' is thus:\n *\n * d(x) = d3x^3 + d2x^2 + d1x + d0\n * with\n * d0 = GF(a0, b0) ^ GF(a3, b1) ^ GF(a2, b2) ^ GF(a1, b3)\n * d1 = GF(a1, b0) ^ GF(a0, b1) ^ GF(a3, b2) ^ GF(a2, b3)\n * d2 = GF(a2, b0) ^ GF(a1, b1) ^ GF(a0, b2) ^ GF(a3, b3)\n * d3 = GF(a3, b0) ^ GF(a2, b1) ^ GF(a1, b2) ^ GF(a0, b3)\n *\n * As a matrix:\n *\n * [d0] = [a0 a3 a2 a1][b0]\n * [d1]   [a1 a0 a3 a2][b1]\n * [d2]   [a2 a1 a0 a3][b2]\n * [d3]   [a3 a2 a1 a0][b3]\n *\n * Special polynomials defined by AES (0x02 == {02}):\n * a(x)    = {03}x^3 + {01}x^2 + {01}x + {02}\n * a^-1(x) = {0b}x^3 + {0d}x^2 + {09}x + {0e}.\n *\n * These polynomials are used in the MixColumns() and InverseMixColumns()\n * operations, respectively, to cause each element in the state to affect\n * the output (referred to as diffusing).\n *\n * RotWord() uses: a0 = a1 = a2 = {00} and a3 = {01}, which is the\n * polynomial x3.\n *\n * The ShiftRows() method modifies the last 3 rows in the state (where\n * the state is 4 words with 4 bytes per word) by shifting bytes cyclically.\n * The 1st byte in the second row is moved to the end of the row. The 1st\n * and 2nd bytes in the third row are moved to the end of the row. The 1st,\n * 2nd, and 3rd bytes are moved in the fourth row.\n *\n * More details on how AES arithmetic works:\n *\n * In the polynomial representation of binary numbers, XOR performs addition\n * and subtraction and multiplication in GF(2^8) denoted as GF(a, b)\n * corresponds with the multiplication of polynomials modulo an irreducible\n * polynomial of degree 8. In other words, for AES, GF(a, b) will multiply\n * polynomial 'a' with polynomial 'b' and then do a modular reduction by\n * an AES-specific irreducible polynomial of degree 8.\n *\n * A polynomial is irreducible if its only divisors are one and itself. For\n * the AES algorithm, this irreducible polynomial is:\n *\n * m(x) = x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1,\n *\n * or {01}{1b} in hexadecimal notation, where each coefficient is a bit:\n * 100011011 = 283 = 0x11b.\n *\n * For example, GF(0x57, 0x83) = 0xc1 because\n *\n * 0x57 = 87  = 01010111 = x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1\n * 0x85 = 131 = 10000101 = x^7 + x + 1\n *\n * (x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1) * (x^7 + x + 1)\n * =  x^13 + x^11 + x^9 + x^8 + x^7 +\n *    x^7 + x^5 + x^3 + x^2 + x +\n *    x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1\n * =  x^13 + x^11 + x^9 + x^8 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 1 = y\n *    y modulo (x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1)\n * =  x^7 + x^6 + 1.\n *\n * The modular reduction by m(x) guarantees the result will be a binary\n * polynomial of less than degree 8, so that it can fit in a byte.\n *\n * The operation to multiply a binary polynomial b with x (the polynomial\n * x in binary representation is 00000010) is:\n *\n * b_7x^8 + b_6x^7 + b_5x^6 + b_4x^5 + b_3x^4 + b_2x^3 + b_1x^2 + b_0x^1\n *\n * To get GF(b, x) we must reduce that by m(x). If b_7 is 0 (that is the\n * most significant bit is 0 in b) then the result is already reduced. If\n * it is 1, then we can reduce it by subtracting m(x) via an XOR.\n *\n * It follows that multiplication by x (00000010 or 0x02) can be implemented\n * by performing a left shift followed by a conditional bitwise XOR with\n * 0x1b. This operation on bytes is denoted by xtime(). Multiplication by\n * higher powers of x can be implemented by repeated application of xtime().\n *\n * By adding intermediate results, multiplication by any constant can be\n * implemented. For instance:\n *\n * GF(0x57, 0x13) = 0xfe because:\n *\n * xtime(b) = (b & 128) ? (b << 1 ^ 0x11b) : (b << 1)\n *\n * Note: We XOR with 0x11b instead of 0x1b because in javascript our\n * datatype for b can be larger than 1 byte, so a left shift will not\n * automatically eliminate bits that overflow a byte ... by XOR'ing the\n * overflow bit with 1 (the extra one from 0x11b) we zero it out.\n *\n * GF(0x57, 0x02) = xtime(0x57) = 0xae\n * GF(0x57, 0x04) = xtime(0xae) = 0x47\n * GF(0x57, 0x08) = xtime(0x47) = 0x8e\n * GF(0x57, 0x10) = xtime(0x8e) = 0x07\n *\n * GF(0x57, 0x13) = GF(0x57, (0x01 ^ 0x02 ^ 0x10))\n *\n * And by the distributive property (since XOR is addition and GF() is\n * multiplication):\n *\n * = GF(0x57, 0x01) ^ GF(0x57, 0x02) ^ GF(0x57, 0x10)\n * = 0x57 ^ 0xae ^ 0x07\n * = 0xfe.\n */\n\nfunction initialize() {\n  init = true;\n  /* Populate the Rcon table.

There are many\n      generators (128 out of 256): 3,5,6,9,11,82 to name a few. To fully\n      traverse GF we iterate 255 times, multiplying by our generator\n      each time.\n       On each iteration we can determine the multiplicative inverse for\n      the current element.\n       Suppose there is an element in GF 'e'. For a given generator 'g',\n      e = g^x. The multiplicative inverse of e is g^(255 - x). It turns\n      out that if use the inverse of a generator as another generator\n      it will produce all of the corresponding multiplicative inverses\n      at the same time. For this reason, we choose 5 as our inverse\n      generator because it only requires 2 multiplies and 1 add and its\n      inverse, 82, requires relatively few operations as well.\n       In order to apply the affine transformation, the multiplicative\n      inverse 'ei' of 'e' can be repeatedly XOR'd (4 times) with a\n      bit-cycling of 'ei'. To do this 'ei' is first stored in 's' and\n      'x'. Then 's' is left shifted and the high bit of 's' is made the\n      low bit. The resulting value is stored in 's'. Then 'x' is XOR'd\n      with 's' and stored in 'x'. On each subsequent iteration the same\n      operation is performed. When 4 iterations are complete, 'x' is\n      XOR'd with 'c' (0x63) and the transformed value is stored in 'x'.\n      For example:\n       s = 01000001\n      x = 01000001\n       iteration 1: s = 10000010, x ^= s\n      iteration 2: s = 00000101, x ^= s\n      iteration 3: s = 00001010, x ^= s\n      iteration 4: s = 00010100, x ^= s\n      x ^= 0x63\n       This can be done with a loop where s = (s << 1) | (s >> 7). However,\n      it can also be done by using a single 16-bit (in this case 32-bit)\n      number 'sx'. Since XOR is an associative operation, we can set 'sx'\n      to 'ei' and then XOR it with 'sx' left-shifted 1,2,3, and 4 times.\n      The most significant bits will flow into the high 8 bit positions\n      and be correctly XOR'd with one another. All that remains will be\n      to cycle the high 8 bits by XOR'ing them all with the lower 8 bits\n      afterwards.\n       At the same time we're populating sbox and isbox we can precompute\n      the multiplication we'll need to do to do MixColumns() later.\n    */\n    // apply affine transformation\n    sx = ei ^ ei << 1 ^ ei << 2 ^ ei << 3 ^ ei << 4;\n    sx = sx >> 8 ^ sx & 255 ^ 0x63; // update tables\n\n    sbox[e] = sx;\n    isbox[sx] = e;\n    /* Mixing columns is done using matrix multiplication. The columns\n      that are to be mixed are each a single word in the current state.\n      The state has Nb columns (4 columns). Therefore each column is a\n      4 byte word. So to mix the columns in a single column 'c' where\n      its rows are r0, r1, r2, and r3, we use the following matrix\n      multiplication:\n       [2 3 1 1]*[r0,c]=[r'0,c]\n      [1 2 3 1] [r1,c] [r'1,c]\n      [1 1 2 3] [r2,c] [r'2,c]\n      [3 1 1 2] [r3,c] [r'3,c]\n       r0, r1, r2, and r3 are each 1 byte of one of the words in the\n      state (a column). To do matrix multiplication for each mixed\n      column c' we multiply the corresponding row from the left matrix\n      with the corresponding column from the right matrix. In total, we\n      get 4 equations:\n       r0,c' = 2*r0,c + 3*r1,c + 1*r2,c + 1*r3,c\n      r1,c' = 1*r0,c + 2*r1,c + 3*r2,c + 1*r3,c\n      r2,c' = 1*r0,c + 1*r1,c + 2*r2,c + 3*r3,c\n      r3,c' = 3*r0,c + 1*r1,c + 1*r2,c + 2*r3,c\n       As usual, the multiplication is as previously defined and the\n      addition is XOR. In order to optimize mixing columns we can store\n      the multiplication results in tables. If you think of the whole\n      column as a word (it might help to visualize by mentally rotating\n      the equations above by counterclockwise 90 degrees) then you can\n      see that it would be useful to map the multiplications performed on\n      each byte (r0, r1, r2, r3) onto a word as well. For instance, we\n      could map 2*r0,1*r0,1*r0,3*r0 onto a word by storing 2*r0 in the\n      highest 8 bits and 3*r0 in the lowest 8 bits (with the other two\n      respectively in the middle). This means that a table can be\n      constructed that uses r0 as an index to the word. We can do the\n      same with r1, r2, and r3, creating a total of 4 tables.\n       To construct a full c', we can just look up each byte of c in\n      their respective tables and XOR the results together.\n       Also, to build each table we only have to calculate the word\n      for 2,1,1,3 for every byte ... which we can do on each iteration\n      of this loop since we will iterate over every byte. After we have\n      calculated 2,1,1,3 we can get the results for the other tables\n      by cycling the byte at the end to the beginning. For instance\n      we can take the result of table 2,1,1,3 and produce table 3,2,1,1\n      by moving the right most byte to the left most position just like\n      how you can imagine the 3 moved out of 2,1,1,3 and to the front\n      to produce 3,2,1,1.\n       There is another optimization in that the same multiples of\n      the current element we need in order to advance our generator\n      to the next iteration can be reused in performing the 2,1,1,3\n      calculation. We also calculate the inverse mix column tables,\n      with e,9,d,b being the inverse of 2,1,1,3.\n       When we're done, and we need to actually mix columns, the first\n      byte of each state word should be put through mix[0] (2,1,1,3),\n      the second through mix[1] (3,2,1,1) and so forth.

But the decrypt algorithm requires\n    us to AddRoundKey() before InvMixColumns(). This means we'll need to\n    apply some transformations to the round key to inverse-mix its columns\n    so they'll be correct for moving AddRoundKey() to after the state has\n    had its columns inverse-mixed.\n     To inverse-mix the columns of the state when we're decrypting we use a\n    lookup table that will apply InvSubBytes() and InvMixColumns() at the\n    same time. However, the round key's bytes are not inverse-substituted\n    in the decryption algorithm. To get around this problem, we can first\n    substitute the bytes in the round key so that when we apply the\n    transformation via the InvSubBytes()+InvMixColumns() table, it will\n    undo our substitution leaving us with the original value that we\n    want -- and then inverse-mix that value.\n     This change will correctly alter our key schedule so that we can XOR\n    each round key with our already transformed decryption state. This\n    allows us to use the same code path as the encryption algorithm.\n     We make one more change to the decryption key.

Each column is stored as a word in the state (the\n      array 'input' has one column as a word at each index). In order to\n      mix a column, we perform these transformations on each row in c,\n      which is 1 byte in each word. The new column for c0 is c'0:\n                m0      m1      m2      m3\n      r0,c'0 = 2*r0,c0 + 3*r1,c0 + 1*r2,c0 + 1*r3,c0\n      r1,c'0 = 1*r0,c0 + 2*r1,c0 + 3*r2,c0 + 1*r3,c0\n      r2,c'0 = 1*r0,c0 + 1*r1,c0 + 2*r2,c0 + 3*r3,c0\n      r3,c'0 = 3*r0,c0 + 1*r1,c0 + 1*r2,c0 + 2*r3,c0\n       So using mix tables where c0 is a word with r0 being its upper\n      8 bits and r3 being its lower 8 bits:\n       m0[c0 >> 24] will yield this word: [2*r0,1*r0,1*r0,3*r0]\n      ...\n      m3[c0 & 255] will yield this word: [1*r3,1*r3,3*r3,2*r3]\n       Therefore to mix the columns in each word in the state we\n      do the following (& 255 omitted for brevity):\n      c'0,r0 = m0[c0 >> 24] ^ m1[c1 >> 16] ^ m2[c2 >> 8] ^ m3[c3]\n      c'0,r1 = m0[c0 >> 24] ^ m1[c1 >> 16] ^ m2[c2 >> 8] ^ m3[c3]\n      c'0,r2 = m0[c0 >> 24] ^ m1[c1 >> 16] ^ m2[c2 >> 8] ^ m3[c3]\n      c'0,r3 = m0[c0 >> 24] ^ m1[c1 >> 16] ^ m2[c2 >> 8] ^ m3[c3]\n       However, before mixing, the algorithm requires us to perform\n      ShiftRows(). The ShiftRows() transformation cyclically shifts the\n      last 3 rows of the state over different offsets. The first row\n      (r = 0) is not shifted.\n       s'_r,c = s_r,(c + shift(r, Nb) mod Nb\n      for 0 < r < 4 and 0 <= c < Nb and\n      shift(1, 4) = 1\n      shift(2, 4) = 2\n      shift(3, 4) = 3.\n       This causes the first byte in r = 1 to be moved to the end of\n      the row, the first 2 bytes in r = 2 to be moved to the end of\n      the row, the first 3 bytes in r = 3 to be moved to the end of\n      the row:\n       r1: [c0 c1 c2 c3] => [c1 c2 c3 c0]\n      r2: [c0 c1 c2 c3]    [c2 c3 c0 c1]\n      r3: [c0 c1 c2 c3]    [c3 c0 c1 c2]\n       We can make these substitutions inline with our column mixing to\n      generate an updated set of equations to produce each word in the\n      state (note the columns have changed positions):\n       c0 c1 c2 c3 => c0 c1 c2 c3\n      c0 c1 c2 c3    c1 c2 c3 c0  (cycled 1 byte)\n      c0 c1 c2 c3    c2 c3 c0 c1  (cycled 2 bytes)\n      c0 c1 c2 c3    c3 c0 c1 c2  (cycled 3 bytes)\n       Therefore:\n       c'0 = 2*r0,c0 + 3*r1,c1 + 1*r2,c2 + 1*r3,c3\n      c'0 = 1*r0,c0 + 2*r1,c1 + 3*r2,c2 + 1*r3,c3\n      c'0 = 1*r0,c0 + 1*r1,c1 + 2*r2,c2 + 3*r3,c3\n      c'0 = 3*r0,c0 + 1*r1,c1 + 1*r2,c2 + 2*r3,c3\n       c'1 = 2*r0,c1 + 3*r1,c2 + 1*r2,c3 + 1*r3,c0\n      c'1 = 1*r0,c1 + 2*r1,c2 + 3*r2,c3 + 1*r3,c0\n      c'1 = 1*r0,c1 + 1*r1,c2 + 2*r2,c3 + 3*r3,c0\n      c'1 = 3*r0,c1 + 1*r1,c2 + 1*r2,c3 + 2*r3,c0\n       ... and so forth for c'2 and c'3. The important distinction is\n      that the columns are cycling, with c0 being used with the m0\n      map when calculating c0, but c1 being used with the m0 map when\n      calculating c1 ... and so forth.\n       When performing the inverse we transform the mirror image and\n      skip the bottom row, instead of the top one, and move upwards:\n       c3 c2 c1 c0 => c0 c3 c2 c1  (cycled 3 bytes) *same as encryption\n      c3 c2 c1 c0    c1 c0 c3 c2  (cycled 2 bytes)\n      c3 c2 c1 c0    c2 c1 c0 c3  (cycled 1 byte)  *same as encryption\n      c3 c2 c1 c0    c3 c2 c1 c0\n       If you compare the resulting matrices for ShiftRows()+MixColumns()\n      and for InvShiftRows()+InvMixColumns() the 2nd and 4th columns are\n      different (in encrypt mode vs. decrypt mode). So in order to use\n      the same code to handle both encryption and decryption, we will\n      need to do some mapping.\n       If in encryption mode we let a=c0, b=c1, c=c2, d=c3, and r<N> be\n      a row number in the state, then the resulting matrix in encryption\n      mode for applying the above transformations would be:\n       r1: a b c d\n      r2: b c d a\n      r3: c d a b\n      r4: d a b c\n       If we did the same in decryption mode we would get:\n       r1: a d c b\n      r2: b a d c\n      r3: c b a d\n      r4: d c b a\n       If instead we swap d and b (set b=c3 and d=c1), then we get:\n       r1: a b c d\n      r2: d a b c\n      r3: c d a b\n      r4: b c d a\n       Now the 1st and 3rd rows are the same as the encryption matrix. All\n      we need to do then to make the mapping exactly the same is to swap\n      the 2nd and 4th rows when in decryption mode. To do this without\n      having to do it on each iteration, we swapped the 2nd and 4th rows\n      in the decryption key schedule. We also have to do the swap above\n      when we first pull in the input and when we set the final output. */\n    a2 = m0[a >>> 24] ^ m1[b >>> 16 & 255] ^ m2[c >>> 8 & 255] ^ m3[d & 255] ^ w[++i];\n    b2 = m0[b >>> 24] ^ m1[c >>> 16 & 255] ^ m2[d >>> 8 & 255] ^ m3[a & 255] ^ w[++i];\n    c2 = m0[c >>> 24] ^ m1[d >>> 16 & 255] ^ m2[a >>> 8 & 255] ^ m3[b & 255] ^ w[++i];\n    d = m0[d >>> 24] ^ m1[a >>> 16 & 255] ^ m2[b >>> 8 & 255] ^ m3[c & 255] ^ w[++i];\n    a = a2;\n    b = b2;\n    c = c2;\n  }\n  /*\n    Encrypt:\n    SubBytes(state)\n    ShiftRows(state)\n    AddRoundKey(state, w[Nr*Nb, (Nr+1)*Nb-1])\n     Decrypt:\n    InvShiftRows(state)\n    InvSubBytes(state)\n    AddRoundKey(state, w[0, Nb-1])\n   */\n  // Note: rows are shifted inline\n\n\n  output[0] = sub[a >>> 24] << 24 ^ sub[b >>> 16 & 255] << 16 ^ sub[c >>> 8 & 255] << 8 ^ sub[d & 255] ^ w[++i];\n  output[decrypt ? 3 : 1] = sub[b >>> 24] << 24 ^ sub[c >>> 16 & 255] << 16 ^ sub[d >>> 8 & 255] << 8 ^ sub[a & 255] ^ w[++i];\n  output[2] = sub[c >>> 24] << 24 ^ sub[d >>> 16 & 255] << 16 ^ sub[a >>> 8 & 255] << 8 ^ sub[b & 255] ^ w[++i];\n  output[decrypt ? 1 : 3] = sub[d >>> 24] << 24 ^ sub[a >>> 16 & 255] << 16 ^ sub[b >>> 8 & 255] << 8 ^ sub[c & 255] ^ w[++i];\n}\n/**\n * Deprecated.

Therefore, the length of the message\n    plus the padding must be congruent to 448 mod 512 because\n    512 - 128 = 448.\n     In order to fill up the message length it must be filled with\n    padding that begins with 1 bit followed by all 0 bits. Padding\n    must *always* be present, so if the message length is already\n    congruent to 448 mod 512, then 512 padding bits must be added. */\n    var finalBlock = forge.util.createBuffer();\n    finalBlock.putBytes(_input.bytes());
